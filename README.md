## 📖 Notes

<details>
  <summary><b>Click to expand</b></summary>

- Always back up your data before flashing. If something goes wrong, it’s better to lose time than lose data — corporate wisdom.

- Many preinstalled apps were removed. This build is a **core/minimal system**, containing only essential applications.  
  You are free to choose what you want to install, as all official Infinix apps are available in the **Extras/Apps Infinix** folder on Google Drive.

- The default Infinix camera is available in the Extras folder on Google Drive.
Both HIOS/XOS stock cameras have lower image quality and are unable to record at 60 FPS due to compatibility limitations.
For the best possible quality and proper 60 FPS recording, it is recommended to use GCam.

- Google Play Store comes **preinstalled by default**.

- To ensure the **integrity system works properly**, please download **KaoriosToolbox.apk** from the **Extras** folder on Google Drive.  
  With Kaorios Toolbox, you can customize several system options — explore at your own risk (and enjoyment).

## 📥 Installation Guide

<details>
<summary><b>Port Flashing</b></summary>

### Method 1: Recovery Installation (Recommended)

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This port **REQUIRES a custom recovery**.  
> Stock recovery **will NOT work**. If you are not using a custom recovery, **do not even try**.

You must install this port using **one of the supported custom recoveries**:
- **[TWRP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bze5K3uk-C6TAVPXHJ0VLOoNIYIx-OLs/view?usp=drive_link)**
- **[OrangeFox (OFOX)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1guAN3IIYP-t-NAWYXJnsPundINDVaWDf/view?usp=drivesdk)**
- **[PitchBlack Recovery (PBRP)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XEPGRTUcHspBFpv5jv2xCs8_LtKhH9L0/view?usp=drivesdk)**

Installation steps:

1. Boot your device into **custom recovery mode** (TWRP / OFOX / PBRP).
2. Perform a **Format Data** to ensure a clean installation.
3. Reboot back into **custom recovery mode**.
4. Copy the **XOS ZIP** to your internal storage.
5. Go to **Install**, select the ZIP file, and **swipe to confirm** the flash.

If you are unable to copy the file to internal storage, you can alternatively use:
- **USB OTG**
- **MicroSD card** (if supported by your device)

---

### Method 2: ADB Sideload (Custom Recovery Required)

ADB Sideload is also supported, but **still requires a custom recovery**:

1. Boot your device into **custom recovery mode**.
2. Navigate to **ADB Sideload**  
   > The location of this option may vary depending on the recovery.  
   > In **TWRP**, go to **Advanced → ADB Sideload**.
3. On your PC terminal, run:
   ```bash
   adb sideload <drag and drop the XOS ZIP here>
   ```
4. Wait for the flashing process to complete, then reboot the system.
